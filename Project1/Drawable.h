 * This is an "interface" that is built upon.  It defines a "Drawable"
 * as an object that contains two draw methods -- one that takes a 
 * transformation matrix and one that does not.  It is intended that the
 * one that takes the transformation matrix will apply the transformation
 * to the object being drawn.
